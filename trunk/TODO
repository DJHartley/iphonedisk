TODO: Stuff that would be nice to do

- Improved documentation and Project Wikis
- Installer + Binary distribution
  - Should detect if MacFUSE is installed, and tell how to install
- Become a long running process with a control pannel, no GUI needed.
- Remove ythread package if possible
- Connection.h documentation and cleanup
