iPhoneDisk is a MacFUSE filesystem for reading and writing data on your iPhone.
It uses the AFC commands built into the MobileDevice library, largely
documented by the iPhone-dev people (yay!).

REQUIREMENTS: You must have MacFUSE installed. See
http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/ for more details on MacFUSE.

The provided shell script makes it easy to mount.  Your iPhone should be
connected, but not connected in iTunes.
