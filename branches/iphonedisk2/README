iphonedisk2
-----------

iphonedisk is a MacFUSE based filesystem that lets you access the contents of
your iphone or ipod via USB.

This package contains a re-write of the original iphoendisk.  The original was
plagued with bugs that were difficult to track down due to the nature of its
design, and this rewrite is an attempt to fix that.

In order to make the system simpler, its split into more moving parts (oops),
with the goal to have fewer lines of code running inside of MacFUSE.  The
different components expose a protocol buffer RPC service which uses Mach IPC
via MIG as the communication channel.

Components:

FsService - Exports a protocol buffer RPC service interface for all filesystem
commands.  The interface looks a lot like the FUSE API.

TODO(allen): Describe the MountService and UI components.
