iphonedisk2
-----------

iphonedisk is a MacFUSE based filesystem that lets you access the contents of
your iphone or ipod via USB.

This package contains a re-write of the original iphoendisk.  The original was
plagued with bugs that were difficult to track down due to the nature of its
design, and this rewrite is an attempt to fix that.

In order to make the system simpler, its split into more moving parts (oops),
with the goal to have fewer lines of code running inside of MacFUSE.  The
different components expose a protocol buffer RPC service which uses Mach IPC
via MIG as the communication channel.  Using Mach IPC is perhaps overkill,
as domain sockets could be used instead, however it seemed fun to try.  One
advantage over domain sockets is that by using the MIG layer, it does all of
the message parsing for you.

Components:

FsService - Exports a protocol buffer RPC service for all filesystem commands.
The interface looks a lot like the FUSE API.

MountService - Exports a protocol buffer RPC service that actually mounts a
fuse volume.  The MountService typically has a FsService channel that it uses to
proxy all of the fuse API calls.
