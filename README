iphonedisk2
-----------

iphonedisk is a MacFUSE based filesystem that lets you access the contents of
your iphone or ipod via USB.

This package contains a re-write of the original iphonedisk.  The original was
plagued with bugs that were difficult to track down due to the nature of its
design, and this rewrite is an attempt to fix that.

The current shipping iphonedisk again runs as a single process, mobile_fs_util,
however contains now GUI.  mobile_fs_util runs as a launch agent that waits
for an iphone USB connection.  The installer package places the launch agent
in /Library/iphonedisk and a .plist file in /Library/Launch Agents/.  The .plist
file has configuration parameters such as the volume icon and volume name used
when the disk is mounted.  You must reload the agent (or your computer) any
time the configuration parameter are changed.

This project uses protocol buffer services as an API between components, but
doesn't actually send any RPCs.  Originally it was going to (to provide some
isolation between components), but in the end it seemed simpler to just put
everything in a single process.
